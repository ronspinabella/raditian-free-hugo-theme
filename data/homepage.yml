  title: "Who am I?"
  content: "I am an SEO Consultant who owns the digital marketing agency Spinabella SEO. I have been in the SEO industry for over ten years and consider myself an advanced SEO. I have two rules that I live by 
    <ul><li><b>Never listen to what Google says</b></li><li><b>Do the opposite of what Google says</b></li></ul><p class=\"lead\">My area of focus lies in Semantic SEO and Link Building. The biggest lie Google ever told was \"Don't Build Links\". If your SEO ever tells you that you don't need links, they are lying. They just don't think they can sell you on paying for them.
